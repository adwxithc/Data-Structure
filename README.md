# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository contains fundamental algorithms and problems in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in JavaScript.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the forked repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Data-Structure.git
   ```
3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Data-Structure
   ```

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `algorithms/`: Contains various algorithm implementations.
- `data_structures/`: Contains implementations of different data structures.
- `problems/`: Contains solutions to various coding problems.
- `README.md`: This file.

## ðŸ“œ Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone. Hereâ€™s how you can help:

### 1. Adding New Problems or Algorithms

1. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution using the following command:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-problem-or-algorithm
   ```
2. **Add your solution**: Add your solution to the appropriate directory (`algorithms/`, `data_structures/`, or `problems/`). Create a new file if necessary.
3. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add solution for [Problem/Algorithm Name]"
   ```
4. **Push to your branch**: Push your changes to your forked repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-problem-or-algorithm
   ```
5. **Create a pull request**: Open a pull request to the main repository. Ensure that your pull request description clearly states the problem or algorithm you are contributing.

### 2. Improving Existing Solutions

1. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for your changes.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/improve-solution
   ```
2. **Make improvements**: Improve the existing solution in the appropriate file.
3. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Improve solution for [Problem/Algorithm Name]"
   ```
4. **Push to your branch**: Push your changes to your forked repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/improve-solution
   ```
5. **Create a pull request**: Open a pull request to the main repository. Ensure that your pull request description clearly explains the improvements made.
